### Added

### Changed

- Expanded the default `core` profile from 28 tools to 34 tools.
- Expanded the `full` profile from 76 tools to 89 tools.
- Updated tool interaction logs to store concise result summaries from the standard envelope.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- Added a panel and tool-level update checker for comparing the installed extension version with the latest GitHub release.
- Added `custom` tool exposure with per-category and per-tool include/exclude configuration.
- Added `get_tool_catalog`, `check_for_updates`, `get_recent_logs`, `search_project_logs`, `clear_logs`, and `validate_scene`.
- Added MCP log resources: `cocos://logs/editor` and `cocos://logs/project`.
- Added in-memory runtime logs alongside the existing MCP interaction history.
- Added optional Streamable HTTP session support via `enableSessions` and `Mcp-Session-Id`.

### Changed

- Expanded the default `core` profile from 22 tools to 28 tools.
- Expanded the `full` profile from 70 tools to 76 tools.
- Updated the Cocos panel to show installed version, update status, session toggle, and tool exposure controls.
- Tightened Streamable HTTP behavior for `Accept` headers, JSON-RPC notifications/responses, `202 Accepted`, unsupported GET/SSE requests, and DELETE session termination.

### Fixed

- Improved project log tailing so trailing blank lines do not hide the last useful log entries.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- Fixed CI test expectations after expanding the documented `core` and `full` tool profiles.
- Aligned the latest release line with the current tested `main` branch state.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Added `get_editor_state` as a compact structured editor-state summary tool.
- Added `get_selection` and `set_selection` as explicit selection workflow tools for editor-side automation.
- Added persistence for the selected one-click MCP client target in the Cocos panel configuration.

### Changed

- Expanded the default `core` profile from 19 tools to 22 tools by promoting editor-state and selection workflows.
- Expanded the `full` profile from 67 tools to 70 tools.
- Updated panel config persistence so changing the selected MCP client target no longer restarts the server unnecessarily.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Added Node.js unit tests for MCP protocol negotiation, tool profile exports, tool execution errors, and project file path safety.

### Changed

- Updated the MCP initialize response to negotiate protocol version `2025-11-25` by default while retaining compatibility with older supported protocol versions.
- Added `structuredContent` to tool call results when a tool returns structured JSON data.
- Changed tool execution failures to return MCP tool errors instead of JSON-RPC internal errors, improving client-side self-correction.
- Updated CI to run the new Node.js test suite.

### Security

- Restricted project file and asset-path resources to paths inside the active Cocos project root.
- Added HTTP request body size limits and invalid `Origin` header rejection for the embedded MCP server.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- Added automatic port fallback when the configured MCP port is already occupied.
- Added actual-running-port reporting in MCP server status and panel state.
- Added `.github/pull_request_template.md` for repository contribution guidance.
- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for lightweight GitHub validation.
- Added a lightweight GitHub Star promotion log after successful MCP server startup.

### Changed

- Updated one-click MCP client configuration to write the actual running server port instead of the requested port when port fallback is active.
- Updated the MCP panel status line to show configured-port to actual-port fallback information.
- Updated the English and Chinese README files to document automatic port fallback behavior.

### Fixed

- Fixed VS Code one-click configuration to use platform-specific config paths with macOS fallback behavior.
- Fixed Windows one-click MCP configuration path resolution by using a more reliable home/appdata lookup strategy.
